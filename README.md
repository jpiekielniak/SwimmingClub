# Python Project ‚Äì Based on *Head First Python* (3rd Edition)

This project was created as part of my learning journey through the book  
**_Head First Python_ (3rd Edition)** by **Paul Barry**.

The goal of this repository is to apply and reinforce the concepts covered in the book,  
including:

- Python basics and syntax
- Working with built-in data types
- File handling and exceptions
- Functions and modules
- Web development with Flask
- Database integration (SQLite)

## About the Book

*Head First Python* is a hands-on, beginner-friendly guide that uses a visually rich format  
to make learning Python both accessible and engaging. The third edition covers Python 3  
and provides updated examples and projects.
